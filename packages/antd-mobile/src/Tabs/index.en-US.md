A `Tabs` is used to allow users to switch between different views.

### Rule

- Generally a `Tabs` should have 2-4 tab pane, the title of each tab pane should be concise，normally has 2-4 words..
- In the secondary page of iOS, it is not recommended to use left and right swipe to switch tab, which conflicts with back swipe gestrue in iOS. eg:  tabs in details page.
