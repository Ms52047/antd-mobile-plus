Note: Just for selecting picture. Generally `ImagePicker` is used to select picture before uploading, but without the feature of uploading. In this Component, we use Promise. Please refer to the description of compatibility in this [Promise document](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).If necessary, refer to [/docs/react/introduce-cn](/docs/react/introduce) for compatibility processing.
