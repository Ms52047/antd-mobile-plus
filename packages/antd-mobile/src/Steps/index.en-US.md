Steps is typically used for displaying the progress of a task, or guiding users through the steps of a complex flow.

### Rules
- Suitable for step-by-step and long-lasting task, e.g. the process of transfer accounts. If the task is continuous and short, such as opening a page, component `Progress` will fit better.
- When the task is complicated or has a certain sequence in the series of subtasks, we can decompose it into several steps to make things easier, e.g. register new account.
