A single and continuous block content is vertically arranged to display current contents, status and available operations. eg：Contact List.

In case you need an infinite scroll list - consider using [ListView](https://mobile.ant.design/components/list-view/) component.

### Rule
- Generally `List` consists of main infomation, main operations, secondary infomation and secondary operations.
- The main infomation and main operations are placed on the left side of list, and secondary infomation and secondary operations are placed on the right side.
